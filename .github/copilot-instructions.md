# Hawk-AI Coding Instructions

## Project Overview
**Hawk-AI** is an AI-driven system. Currently in early development. These instructions establish conventions for AI agents to maintain consistency and productivity as the codebase grows.

## Architecture & Key Components
_To be populated as the codebase develops. Structure for:_
- **Core AI/ML Module**: [location/to/core]
- **API Layer**: [location/to/api]
- **Data Pipeline**: [location/to/data]
- **Configuration**: [location/to/config]

Reference key files when components are created to show data flow, integration patterns, and dependencies.

## Development Workflow

### Setup
_Add your setup command here:_
```bash
# npm install
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# docker-compose up
```

### Building & Running
```bash
# Build: [your build command]
# Run: [your run command]
# Test: [your test command]
```

### Testing
- Test runner: [specify framework - pytest, jest, unittest, etc.]
- Test location pattern: `[test/*, tests/*, **/*.test.ts, etc.]`
- Command: `[how to run tests]`

## Code Conventions & Patterns

### Language/Framework Standards
_Define when implemented:_
- Naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
- File structure and organization
- Module/import patterns
- Error handling approach

### Project-Specific Patterns
_Examples to document:_
- How configuration is managed (environment variables, config files, etc.)
- Authentication/authorization patterns if applicable
- Logging and observability conventions
- How external APIs/services are integrated

## Critical Integration Points

### External Dependencies
_Document key dependencies:_
- Third-party services (APIs, databases, ML models)
- Critical libraries and their purposes
- Version constraints or compatibility notes

### Data Flow & Communication
- How components exchange data
- Message format or API contract examples
- Performance or scaling considerations

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. [Describe your typical feature implementation pattern]
2. Example reference: [link to exemplary feature]

### Debugging
- Key debugging tools/commands
- Common issues and solutions
- Where to find logs: [logging location]

### Deployment
- Pre-deployment checklist
- Deployment process and rollback procedures

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command/Path |
